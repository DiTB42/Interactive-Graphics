# âœ¨ Magical Cave â€” Interactive Graphics Project

This repository contains the assignments and final project for the **Interactive Graphics course** at **Sapienza University of Rome**.  

The highlight of the repository is the **Final Project: Magical Cave**, a fully interactive 3D WebGL scene featuring procedural crystals, animated water, glowing fairies, and more â€” all implemented **without external engines** (pure WebGL).  


## ðŸª„ The Magical Cave Project

### Features
- Procedural cave geometry (dome + rocky floor and others)
- Realistic **PBR materials** with textures (albedo, normal, roughness, etc.)
- **Glowing crystals** with dynamic light emission
- **Animated water surface** with ripples and reflections
- **Falling drops** affecting the water simulation
- **Fairies (Navi-style)** with glowing bodies and flapping wings
- **Interactive object** rising sword
- **Keyboard & mouse camera control**

Everything is built in **WebGL**, with custom shaders for lighting, shading, and effects.
